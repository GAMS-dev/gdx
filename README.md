# gdxnative

Native C++17 re-implementation of (proper) subset of classic expert-level GDX API. Should make "gdxio/gxfile.pas" obsolete and published as open source eventually.

TODOs are tracked in [issue 1](https://git.gams.com/devel/gdxnative/-/issues/1).

## Long term
- Not only statically linked but also available as DLL
- Reading older GDX format versions
