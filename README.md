# gdxnative

Native C++17 re-implementation of (proper) subset of classic expert-level GDX API. Should make "gdxio/gxfile.pas" obsolete and published as open source eventually. Relying somewhat on code taken/copied from [CPPMEX](https://git.gams.com/devel/cppmex) but also providing GDX functionality to CPPMEX back. Currently shared files of both repositories are manually synced by @aschnabel.

TODOs are tracked in [issue 1](https://git.gams.com/devel/gdxnative/-/issues/1).

## Long term
- Integration into [devel/products](https://git.gams.com/devel/products/-/merge_requests/1645)
- Reading older GDX format versions
