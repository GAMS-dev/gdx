- 7.11.9:
    - Made gdxOpenRead not lock the file (from being deleted) on Windows.
- 7.11.8:
    - Added C++ port of GDX utilities gdxdiff, gdxdump, and gdxmerge.
- 7.11.7:
    - Fix building GDX on arm64 with GCC (char is unsigned by default there).
    - Multiple cosmetic changes.
    - Another batch of changes to infrastructure code and CI pipeline that is not directly affecting GDX.
- 7.11.6:
    - Make building (so far) unused infrastructure classes in CMake project optional.
    - Added toggles to disable building tests and examples as part of CMake project (use -DNO_TESTS=ON or -DNO_EXAMPLES=ON).
    - Extended README with short recipe for quickly building a minimal GDX library with CMake.
- 7.11.5:
    - Fixed gdxOpenAppend not indicating a problem (in the return code) when trying to append to a GDX file with format version before 7 (incompatible for appending).
    - Fixed gdxDataReadMap crashing when record (user-mapped) UEL indices are out of bounds (index exceeds number of UELs).
- 7.11.4:
    - Multiple small fixes to infrastructure code and shared modules.
- 7.11.3:
    - Reworked internally used file IO streams to utilize low-level WinAPI/POSIX functions instead of the more heavyweight std::fstream.
    - Use more efficient integer to string conversion procedure for tracing outputs.
    - Reduced width of trace level and file mode enum values from 4 byte to 1 byte.
    - Adjusted compiler flags for new clang-based Intel C++ compiler in CMake project.
    - Many performance improvements in auxiliary classes to be used by future GDX utilities.
- 7.11.2:
    - Added multiple auxiliary classes as preparation for soon to be released GDX related utilities.
    - Fixed memory alignment in custom memory allocator.
    - Prevent signed integer overflow in internally used hashmap class.
- 7.11.1:
    - gdxUMUelGet was modified to accept a NULL pointer for the user UEL index mapping "UelMap".
    - Added two new example programs xp_associative(_vec) and xp_dataWrite.
    - macOS libraries deployed with GitHub release are now universal (also support Intel) instead of only arm64.
    - Also release libraries for static linking on all platforms.
    - Added gdxDataWriteRawStartKeyBounds that allows supplying UEL index lower and upper bounds per symbol dimension.
- 7.10.1:
    - First open source release of GDX eXPert-level API. Compatible with GAMS 45.
    - Added gdxAllowBogusDomains to get flag to ignore using 1-dim sets as domain when their elements are not tracked (see gdxStoreDomainSets).
    - Added script to automatically generate C-wrapper from API definition YAML file.
    - Added boolean property gdxMapAcronymsToNaN (disabled by default) that maps all acronym values to special value "Not a Number" (NaN).
    - Removed XCode project file for unit test suite as it is not maintained anymore.

      Entries for property setters and getters in main header and wrappers are now automatically generated from API
      definition YAML via Jinja2 templates and not handwritten.
