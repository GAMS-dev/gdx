- 7.11.17:
    - Include path to file that cannot be opened in error message after gdxOpenRead* failed due to missing file.
- 7.11.16:
    - Drastically improve performance of `gdxOpenRead` for GDX files with many UELs by reducing the memory allocation count.
    - Drop many GAMS infrastructure source files not actively used by GDX library.
- 7.11.15:
    - Fixed an issue where `gdxmerge` would fail with a "Symbol is too large" error when merging GDX files containing large symbols.
- 7.11.14:
    - Correctly deal with GDX files that have long absolute paths (>260 characters) in GDX library and all tools (`gdxdump`, `gdxdiff`, `gdxmerge`).
- 7.11.13:
    - Fixed the processing of commands via a text file (`@filename`) in `gdxmerge`.
    - Corrected documentation of `SyNr` argument of `gdxSymbolGetDomain(X)`.
    - Updated copyright notices in source file headers.
    - Miscellaneous changes in shared infrastructure code triggered by other GAMS projects.
- 7.11.12:
    - Added internal codes for arm64 architecture on Linux (previously only available for macOS)
- 7.11.11:
    - Changed extension for C++ header files from *.h to *.hpp to fix potentially incorrect classification as C headers from tooling.
- 7.11.10:
    - Multiple small fixes to infrastructure code, shared modules, and hardening compiler flags.
- 7.11.9:
    - Made gdxOpenRead not lock the file (from being deleted) on Windows.
    - Removed unnecessary dependency on "dladdr" as requested in GitHub issue.
- 7.11.8:
    - Added C++ port of GDX utilities gdxdiff, gdxdump, and gdxmerge.
- 7.11.7:
    - Fix building GDX on arm64 with GCC (char is unsigned by default there).
    - Multiple cosmetic changes.
    - Another batch of changes to infrastructure code and CI pipeline that is not directly affecting GDX.
- 7.11.6:
    - Make building (so far) unused infrastructure classes in CMake project optional.
    - Added toggles to disable building tests and examples as part of CMake project (use -DNO_TESTS=ON or -DNO_EXAMPLES=ON).
    - Extended README with short recipe for quickly building a minimal GDX library with CMake.
- 7.11.5:
    - Fixed gdxOpenAppend not indicating a problem (in the return code) when trying to append to a GDX file with format version before 7 (incompatible for appending).
    - Fixed gdxDataReadMap crashing when record (user-mapped) UEL indices are out of bounds (index exceeds number of UELs).
- 7.11.4:
    - Multiple small fixes to infrastructure code and shared modules.
- 7.11.3:
    - Reworked internally used file IO streams to utilize low-level WinAPI/POSIX functions instead of the more heavyweight std::fstream.
    - Use more efficient integer to string conversion procedure for tracing outputs.
    - Reduced width of trace level and file mode enum values from 4 byte to 1 byte.
    - Adjusted compiler flags for new clang-based Intel C++ compiler in CMake project.
    - Many performance improvements in auxiliary classes to be used by future GDX utilities.
- 7.11.2:
    - Added multiple auxiliary classes as preparation for soon to be released GDX related utilities.
    - Fixed memory alignment in custom memory allocator.
    - Prevent signed integer overflow in internally used hashmap class.
- 7.11.1:
    - gdxUMUelGet was modified to accept a NULL pointer for the user UEL index mapping "UelMap".
    - Added two new example programs xp_associative(_vec) and xp_dataWrite.
    - macOS libraries deployed with GitHub release are now universal (also support Intel) instead of only arm64.
    - Also release libraries for static linking on all platforms.
    - Added gdxDataWriteRawStartKeyBounds that allows supplying UEL index lower and upper bounds per symbol dimension.
- 7.10.1:
    - First open source release of GDX eXPert-level API. Compatible with GAMS 45.
    - Added gdxAllowBogusDomains to get flag to ignore using 1-dim sets as domain when their elements are not tracked (see gdxStoreDomainSets).
    - Added script to automatically generate C-wrapper from API definition YAML file.
    - Added boolean property gdxMapAcronymsToNaN (disabled by default) that maps all acronym values to special value "Not a Number" (NaN).
    - Removed XCode project file for unit test suite as it is not maintained anymore.
    - >
      Entries for property setters and getters in main header and wrappers are now automatically generated from API
      definition YAML via Jinja2 templates and not handwritten.
